# Alan-Wangsgard-project
This angular SPA consumes the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/). Using the data provided by this api, the project allows a use to do a few different things. A user can provide the name of a pojemon and will be shown different information about the pokemon on the pokeinfo page. There is also a mini-game where a user is given a randomly generated pokemon from the pokeapi, and an opponent pokemon that is also randomly generated from the poke api. Whichever pokemon's health reaches 0 first loses.
